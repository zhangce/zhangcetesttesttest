## About Me

<img align="right" src="https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.person_image.jpeg?persid=MjMwNDI1" width="150px" style="margin:10px 10px"/>

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at ETH Zurich (since 2016). The goal of my research is to make machine learning techniques widely accessible—while being cost-efficient and trustworthy—to everyone who wants to use them to make our world a better place. 

Before ETH, I finished my PhD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and spent another year as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford. 

With a background in data management, we believe in a system approach. Our current research focues on building next-generation machine learning platforms and systems that are data-centric, human-centric, and declaratively scalable.

Check out a summary of our research [here](./docs/research.html). We are also helping to build up two exciting start-up companies:
  - **[Together Computer](https://www.together.xyz/)**: A decentralized cloud for 
artificial intelligence, with the mission to bring the world's computation together to support the open models ecosystem.
  - **[Modulos.AI](https://www.modulos.ai/)**: Data-centric AI enterprise platform helps you find the errors, noise and bias in your data so you can build fairer and better AI, faster.

As a research group, one of the most important duty is to nurture the next generation of leaders, which arguably gives us the most significant long-lasting impact to our society. Over the years, students graduated from our groups have became professors in great universities and researchers and engineers in leading industrial companies. See a list and their achievements [here](./docs/students.html).
